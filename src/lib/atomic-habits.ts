Key Concepts from "Atomic Habits" by James Clear:

1. The Four Laws of Behavior Change:
   - Make it Obvious (Cue)
   - Make it Attractive (Craving)
   - Make it Easy (Response)
   - Make it Satisfying (Reward)

2. Habit Stacking:
   - Link new habits to existing ones
   - Formula: "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]"

3. Environment Design:
   - Make good habits obvious and easy
   - Make bad habits invisible and difficult

4. The Plateau of Latent Potential:
   - Changes often appear suddenly after long periods of work
   - Focus on systems instead of goals

5. Identity-Based Habits:
   - Focus on who you want to become
   - Every action is a vote for your identity

6. The Two-Minute Rule:
   - Start new habits with a two-minute version
   - Scale up gradually

7. Habit Tracking:
   - Don't break the chain
   - Never miss twice

8. Temptation Bundling:
   - Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do

9. Deliberate Practice:
   - Review and reflect regularly
   - Make small, incremental improvements

10. Habit Stacking Formula Examples:
    - "After I pour my morning coffee, I will meditate for one minute."
    - "After I meditate, I will write my to-do list."
    - "After I write my to-do list, I will immediately begin my first task."

Implementation Guidelines:
1. Start with an incredibly small habit
2. Increase your habit in very small ways
3. As you build up, break habits into chunks
4. When you fail, get back on track quickly
5. Be patient and focus on long-term progress`
